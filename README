BreakOut Arcade!
=============

Anthony (Cosah) and I are determined to spend the weekend creating an epic
version of the game BreakOut.

This will be Arcade style so the game will be hosted online and have a
leader board for everyone to compete with.

To start off with we will be using the code for "paddle ball with simple score"
found on KhanAcademy.com and use Processing.js to create the game.

Milestones
-------

* First of all, we need to get the KhanAcademy paddle ball version working
* Attach the scoring system to a server, record a name with a scores to a DB
* Display a LeaderBoard
* Modify
