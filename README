Log
================
20120818 - I got paddle ball working in Processing.js but the folks in
            ##javascript irc suggested that I build completely in JS rather
            than using a foreign processor. I've moved all the processing
            stuff to index-p5.html

20120818 - Got paddle ball working in javascript
20120819 - Got the slapper to work, replaced setTimeout with rAF
            more importantly I found a better tutorial we should have been
            using as the original codebase: (damn!)
