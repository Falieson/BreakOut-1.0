BreakOut Arcade!
================
Anthony (Cosah) and I are determined to spend the weekend creating an epic
version of the game BreakOut.

This will be Arcade style so the game will be hosted online and have a
leader board for everyone to compete with.

To start off with we will be using the code for "paddle ball with simple score"
found on KhanAcademy.com and use Processing.js to create the game.

Milestones - Base Camp 1 (By August 19th, 2012)
-----------------------------------------------

* First of all, we need to get the KhanAcademy paddle ball version working
* Attach the scoring system to a server, record a name with a scores to a DB
* Display a LeaderBoard
* Modify PaddleBall to display breakable bricks of a single type
* Create a new level when all the bricks are destroyed
** Store score when a level is complete (separate table in DB)

// If we get this all done by the end of the weekend I (Florian) will be
// Thoroughly impressed.


Long Term Features
-----------------------------------------------
* Change the paddle to a bumper, clicking the bumper when the ball
    hits it will increase the speed of the ball. Therefore, add some air drag
    to the ball.

* Multiple Brick Types. Give bricks health, harder you hit the brick
    the more damage the brick takes.

* Random placement of different brick types dependent on value by level

* Drops that give special powers to the player

* Awesome visual effects (such as the ball flaming the more power it has)
    three.js is a library that helps with making pretty animations.

* The ball gains power by collecting mass and speed. Speed is increased by
    the ball being "slapped" by the paddle. The ball gains mass by collecting
    certain drops from destroying bricks.

20120818 - I got paddle ball working in Processing.js but the folks in
            ##javascript irc suggested that I build completely in JS rather
            than using a foreign processor. I've moved all the processing
            stuff to index-p5.html
